This program has two implementions one of them is commented out. One makes use of a variable to keep track of the highest bidder so far and the other uses a dictionary. The implementation that is commented out is more efficient but I wanted to practice using
dictionaries. The second implementation makes use of a dictionary and clears the console after every input. I added a few extras such as making sure it was given valid input, identifying the operating system to clear the terminal, and making sure the bid appeared
with two decimal places even when given a whole number when printed out.
